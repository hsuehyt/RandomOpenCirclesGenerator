## Overview

The **Random Open Circles Generator** is a script designed for 3D artists and modelers to procedurally generate open circles on mesh surfaces. This tool facilitates the creation of intricate patterns and designs, enhancing the detailing process in Autodesk Maya workflows.

## Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Automatically creates open circles on selected mesh surfaces.
- **Customization**: Offers parameters to adjust the size, number, and distribution of circles.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into Autodesk Maya 2022 and later.

## Prerequisites

- **Autodesk Maya 2022 or later** with **Python 3 support**.
- Basic understanding of running scripts within Maya.

## Installation

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Clone the repository or download the script file directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hsuehyt/RandomOpenCirclesGenerator).

2. **Open the Script Editor in Autodesk Maya**:
   - Launch Maya 2022 or later.
   - Navigate to the Script Editor where scripts can be executed.

## Usage

## Compatibility

This script is written in **Python 3** and is **exclusively for Autodesk Maya 2022 and later**. Since Maya 2022 introduced Python 3 as the default, ensure your Maya version is running in Python 3 mode for proper execution.

## Parameters

The script provides several parameters to customize the generated circles:

- **Circle Count**: Number of circles to generate.
- **Radius Range**: Minimum and maximum radius of the circles.
- **Distribution Area**: Defines the area on the mesh where circles will be placed.
- **Random Seed**: Seed value for randomization to ensure reproducibility.
